# AES

AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a symmetric encryption algorithm widely used for secure data encryption.

One of the C++ program uses OpenMP to parallelize AES encryption and decryption across multiple blocks. It leverages the OpenSSL AES library for cryptographic operations.

CUDA implementation parallelizes AES encryption by processing multiple blocks simultaneously. It utilizes OpenSSL's AES library for encryption and launches CUDA threads for parallel execution.
